Reset Doors and Fog - Remastered

Adds a button to the Walls Menu to Shut all doors in the current scene. Also adds a menu to the context dropdown for the Scene Navigation and Scene Directory menus to shut all doors and delete fog in the selected scene to prepare it for a fresh visit from characters. I find it useful after QAing a new map for holes in walls/doors and checking lighting, etc.

*REMASTERED*

Remastered changes the functionality from closing ALL doors to closing ONLY opened doors.
Doors that are currently locked remain locked, and are not closed.

## Installation

It's always easiest to install modules from the in game add-on browser.

To install this module manually:
1.  Inside the Foundry "Configuration and Setup" screen, click "Add-on Modules"
2.  Click "Install Module"
3.  In the "Manifest URL" field, paste the following url:
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wsaunders1014/resetdoorsandfog/main/src/module.json`
4.  Click 'Install' and wait for installation to complete
5.  Don't forget to enable the module in game using the "Manage Module" button
